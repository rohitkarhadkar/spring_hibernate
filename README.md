# Hibernate CRUD Operations Project

This Hibernate project performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data using Hibernate's API. Both HQL (Hibernate Query Language) and session factory methods are utilized for data manipulation.

## Features

- **Basic CRUD Operations**: Implements CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student data, showcasing fundamental data management capabilities.
- **HQL Queries**: Utilizes Hibernate Query Language (HQL) for executing database queries, providing flexibility in data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Session Factory Methods**: Demonstrates the usage of session factory methods for performing database operations, highlighting different techniques for accessing data.
- **Hibernate Configuration**: Includes configuration settings in the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file for database connection, SQL dialect, connection pooling, and session context.

## Project Structure

The project structure includes the following components:

- `Main` class: Contains the main method to demonstrate CRUD operations on student data using both HQL and session factory methods.
- `Student` entity: Represents a student with attributes such as ID, name, and enrollment date.
